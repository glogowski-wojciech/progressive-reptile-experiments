# Two columns capacity

Two-column network has more than 2 times more parameters than original network (2 times + lateral connections). In this experiment we lower number of channels to get a little lower number of parameters than in the original network. In this way we check how much capacity to store information has such architecture of nework and we comapre this with architecture of original network.
